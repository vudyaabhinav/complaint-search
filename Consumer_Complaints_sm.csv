10/17/2016,Consumer Loan,Vehicle loan,Managing the loan or lease,,"I purchased a new car on XXXX XXXX. The car dealer called Citizens Bank to get a 10 day payoff on my loan, good till XXXX XXXX. The dealer sent the check the next day. When I balanced my checkbook on XXXX XXXX. I noticed that Citizens bank had taken the automatic payment out of my checking account at XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank. I called Citizens and they stated that they did not close the loan until XXXX XXXX. ( stating that they did not receive the check until XXXX. XXXX. ). I told them that I did not believe that the check took that long to arrive. XXXX told me a check was issued to me for the amount overpaid, they deducted additional interest. Today ( XXXX XXXX, ) I called Citizens Bank again and talked to a supervisor named XXXX, because on XXXX XXXX. I received a letter that the loan had been paid in full ( dated XXXX, XXXX ) but no refund check was included. XXXX stated that they hold any over payment for 10 business days after the loan was satisfied and that my check would be mailed out on Wed. the XX/XX/XXXX.. I questioned her about the delay in posting the dealer payment and she first stated that sometimes it takes 3 or 4 business days to post, then she said they did not receive the check till XXXX XXXX I again told her that I did not believe this and asked where is my money. She then stated that they hold the over payment for 10 business days. I asked her why, and she simply said that is their policy. I asked her if I would receive interest on my money and she stated no. I believe that Citizens bank is deliberately delaying the posting of payment and the return of consumer 's money to make additional interest for the bank. If this is not illegal it should be, it does hurt the consumer and is not ethical. My amount of money lost is minimal but if they are doing this on thousands of car loans a month, then the additional interest earned for them could be staggering. I still have another car loan from Citizens Bank and I am afraid when I trade that car in another year I will run into the same problem again.",,"CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.",PA,177XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,10/20/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2163100

02/28/2017,Credit card,,Other fee,,"Was a happy XXXX card member for years, in late XX/XX/2016 XXXX converted the card portfolio to Barclaycard ( XXXX ). We almost never carry a balance over, but we started to in XX/XX/XXXX and Barclay has been overcharging the interest expense every month. Instead of charging interest on the carried balance they charged it on the entire average balance. So if we charged {$3000.00} last month and carried {$3000.00} from previous months then they charged us 15 % of the {$6000.00} = {$75.00}, should have been {$37.00} in interest charges. They are double dipping, getting the interchange fee ( 1.5 % of purchase, equal to an 18 % apr ), plus they are getting the interest on the purchases at 15 %, that is the equivalent of an 33 % interest charge. 
I feel this practice is very unethical, if not illegal. We converted, not by our choice, from XXXX to Barclaycard MasterCard, so if we leave we lose all the points we acquired in previous years.

It appears that they are using tactics that may be violating consumer protection law in debt collection practices depriving consumers of their rights to dispute. 

1 In XXXX XXXX, I received a notice from the above company, The next day, I contacted their offices as instructed -- the memo dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX instruct me to contact the plaintiff attorney, not the court. I followed the instructions provided and contacted the plaintiff attorney by phone and also faxed a letter on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX disputing the debt ( see letter ). 

2. The company responded with a letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX by sending me a bill with a due date for XXXX. I had requested a bill showing what my balance was back when I made a payment back in XXXX XXXX for {$100.00}. I was disputing the amount owed, disputing the charges. 

3. I wrote back to the company and faxed another dispute letter on XXXX XXXX, XXXX continue to dispute the amount owed. 

4. The company sent me a response on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX saying that they furnished me the information, I was not disputing that I owe XXXX XXXX, I was disputing that the balance was inaccurate and that I needed proof of the last known charges and activity on the account which was XXXX XXXX. In the last paragraph of their letter it indicated that if I was disputing the amount to send a letter and so on.. 

5. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX -- I sent another letter to the company disputing the balance and requesting the documents again. 

The company never responded to my XXXX XXXX letter, they since had not communication with me, until XXXX XXXX XXXX when I received a letter from them with a copy of a DEFAULT judgment that they filed the court clerk 's office indicating that I failed to respond to their judgment. 

Facts:1. The only judgment that the above firm served me with was the original judgment which I am attaching dispute letters showing that I RESPONDED as instructed to their office on XXXX different occasions. 
2. The plaintiff failed to respond to my dispute and furnish the information provided-and was probably unable to obtain proof of the original of the debt3. Instead of using credible legal procedure to settle the debts, they utilized unfaithful and dirty tactics, violated my rights. 
4. Went to the court, committed perjury under the law by filing false documents with the court that I defaulted on the judgment and failed to respond when in fact I responded and they failed to furnish proof. 
5. I went the court house and the clerk 's office, I was told that the company did not notify their offices that they had been in contact with me, instead they the company told the court and clerk 's office that I did not respond to their summons the the clerks office granted them the default judgement based on their false information that I did not respond to their summons.

06/28/2016,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"I went through a divorce several years ago and requested a home loan modification through Bank of America. Bank of America refused to get back to me on several occasions causing the process to take a year, destroying my credit in the process. Only when they got the foreclosure judgment and sent it to sheriff sale did they process it correctly and I paid on time for over a year. We decided to sell the home in 2015 and listed it for sale. After about 75 days, we received an offer and accepted. We promptly got an apartment, paid a deposit and signed a lease. We moved into the new apartment about 5 days before closing. As we were preparing for closing, it was discovered by the purchasing lender ( unknown to me ) that Bank of America had sold our overdue principal to HUD. This required us to sell our home for over {$150000.00} to break even. The house only appraised at around {$120000.00} because there have been so many foreclosures in our area. I contacted Bank of America to determine what we could do and informed them that we had a buyer if they could process the short sale immediately. They said that they would probably not be able to and "" hopefully the buyer was still around ''. They went through the same process of continually requesting updated information for months while the process dragged on. I lost my buyer and could make the mortgage payments AND the rent payment on my apartment so I continued to work through the home modification process. I contacted their lawyers several times, received a response on a few occassions. Finally, on XXXX XXXX, I received an email back from XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX ( Bank of America 's attorney ) saying that my loan has been "" service released '' to XXXX XXXX. I immediately called them to restart the process and was sent out a packet. I was in the process of submitting the packet and gathering all of the info they needed. My wife drove by the house and there was a sherrif sale notification on it for XX/XX/XXXX. Bank of America, who would no longer work with me and would never respond and sold it to XXXX, processed a sheriff sale. They began the sheriff sale process AFTER I was informed by their lawyers that they no longer serviced the loan! I called XXXX and they confirmed that Bank of America did complete that.

It has been difficult for me to find my past due balance. I missed a regular monthly payment. When I attempted to make a payment to try to get caught up I could not find my past due balance. My printed statement listed a past due balance, but it did not list a payment that I had made prior to the statement being generated. My online account did not list a past due balance at all. It only told me that I had a regular monthly payment due. It also did not list any late fees or other fees of any kind. I then received a letter stating that my mortgage was now in default. This confused me even more because neither my statement or online account had any information about my loan being in default. Also, I did n't think my loan could be in default because I was approximately 30 days past due. I called SPS. When I called and entered in my account information, I was greeted by an audio recording stating that I had a regular monthly payment due. The recording made no reference to a past due balance or to my loan being in default or to any fees that may be due. I selected the option to speak with a representative. Prior to speaking with a representative I was greeted by another recording stating that I was about to speak with a "" debt collector '' and that any information given would be used in order to "" collect on a debt ''. At this point I felt SPS was deliberately trying to confuse and intimidate me. Is SPS a mortgage loan servicer or a debt collector? Is my account in default or past due? What is my past due balance? The rep I spoke with was polite, but not helpful. I did finally get my current past due balance. However, I was threatened with "" legal action '' if my account was not made current with in 6 days. I was not given an answer to why my online account does not reflect my past due balance, is my loan in default or past due, why do I have to pay {$15.00} to make an online payment, why did my interest rate go up. Furthermore, I was given unclear answers about what kind of a company SPS is ( mortgage loan servicer or debt collector ), why do they use intimidating language both in documents and over the phone, is SPS purposefully trying to confuse me.

01/10/2017,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Can't repay my loan,Can't get flexible payment options,"I was dropped from my income based repayment plan by FedLoan servicing in XXXX of 2016. they contacted me by email but never tried to call me, even after being delinquent for over 2 months, ( while they had my current phone number on file ). When I checked my loans myself, I found statements saying I needed to pay over XXXX dollars of standard repayments that had accrued in order to remove the delinquency ( i believe this is predatory and illegal ). Instead I contacted an Ombudsman from the XXXX. She instructed me to declare forbearance ( which Fedloan services did not tell me was an option. FedLoan services told me I had to pay the full 2 months payments on a standard repayment plan I was now on, and continue to pay that amount until a new IBR payment plan was processed. this sounded fraudulent so I contacted a XXXX ombudsman. 

After the Ombudsman talked with the student loan company, both parties ( lender and ombudsman ) told me on XXXX XXXX that I would be entered into forbearance and a new loan document asking me to pay a nominal {$5.00} fee would be sent to me. After this fee is payed, I was told I would enter my repayment plan. I was assured my application was in their system and being processed, and Fedloan services person even confirmed they had my income verification documents showing I made around {$16000.00}, and would pay XXXX on an IBR plan. All I had to do was pay a {$5.00} fee to place the loan back on the payment plan. They said I should allow 3 weeks for them to "" process '' my plan, even though they literally had every piece of information in front of them. 

On XXXX XXXX I received a letter informing me they were missing documentation of my income, which makes no sense, because the woman over the phone was able to tell me my income 4 days earlier. when I called Fedloan services they tell me I need to fill out a paper application for the IBR plan, and submit paper copies of my income verification which directly contradicts everything they told the ombudsman, and everything it says on both their website and XXXX. why do they even have an app with income verification tools if you need to send a paper application as well? 

I believe this company removed me from my plan in the first place in order to threaten me with fraudulent back payments. since early XXXX I have been trying to have my IBR plan processed, which is supposed to take less than 2 weeks and it is taking over 2 months. I have had to reapply for the IBR XXXX separate times now in 2 months, and have gone onto forbearence twice and Fedloan services has instructed me at every turn to fill out another form or send something in, or wait 3 weeks for somethings to be processed. 

This entire time I have been living on an income of less than {$900.00} per month, working part time, and I can prove all of this. So I am well below the threshold for an IBR plan, and they even told me over the phone that I was eligible for {$0.00} payments. there is no excuse for them to be dragging their feet except to force me out of the IBR plan and into a plan where they can collect more money for not processing my information. 

I am still actively trying to pursue this matter with the ombudsman and Fedloan services, but I want to enter a formal complaint with the CFPB, as the behavior of my loan servicer has been dishonest and ( purposely! ) confusing, slow and incompetent to throw people like me into default so they can make more money off of fees.",,AES/PHEAA,MI,488XX,,Consent provided,Web,01/10/2017,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,2283195
06/01/2016,Bank account or service,Other bank product/service,"Making/receiving payments, sending money",,"This complaint is regarding Wells Fargo. XX/XX/XXXX I refinanced my home mortgage taking cash out to make home repairs, pay off an auto loan and pay off an installment loan with Wells Fargo. On XXXX/XXXX/16 I made the final payment on the installment loan at a local Wells Fargo branch. This check included a slight overpayment. The payment on the loan, final accrued interest and overpayment were all processed on XXXX/XXXX/16. On XXXX/XXXX/16 Wells Fargo reversed the entire amount paid on XXXX/XXXX/16 telling me the loan payoff was coded incorrectly. The representative on the phone told me on XXXX/XXXX/16 the loan payment was being reprocessed and should be back dated to the actual payment date. In the meantime, Wells Fargo is telling me the same installment loan is past due and put a {$39.00} late charge on the account. On XXXX/XXXX/16 I called customer service to find out why the reprocessing of the loan payoff still had not gone through. I was told it was still in process. On Saturday, XXXX/XXXX/16 I went to the local branch where the original payment was made back on XXXX/XXXX/16. The personal banker called on this same installment loan and was told the payment was not made correctly. And that Wells Fargo is reprocessing the payment. This personal banker in the branch said everything was applied correctly on her end, so she felt this should be resolved and soon. Today, XXXX/XXXX/16 I contacted Wells Fargo customer service via phone again and was informed the bank check from the title company was returned for insufficient funds twice. We contacted the title company who confirmed verbally the check for the loan cleared their bank on XXXX/XXXX/16. Account numbers and check numbers were confirmed. Payments were due on this installment loan on the XXXX of each month. The loan is now XXXX days past due according to Wells Fargo. Yet I have a receipt with a transaction number proving I paid the loan IN FULL on XXXX/XXXX/16. This loan pay off was rolled into my current mortgage with Wells Fargo. So I feel they are trying to collect on the same debt twice and/or lost {$6800.00}!

My now-deceased father had a reverse mortgage ; so, essentially, my daughter refinanced the home in her name. Throughout the process of my daughter obtaining a loan from her financial lender, the reverse mortgage company and it 's attorneys pursued foreclosure. During the process of attempting to take over the property and without the knowledge of the estate, the reverse mortgage company made a highly unusual payment of taxes on the property.

However, instead of the title company XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX Maryland XXXX remitting a check due back to me as the seller on behalf of the estate, XXXX XXXX XXXX illegally credited the reverse mortgage company money including part of what the estate had paid.

03/25/2015,Debt collection,"Other (i.e. phone, health club, etc.)",Communication tactics,Frequent or repeated calls,"My complaint is n't about phone calls, but I believe "" communication tactics '' was the closest to my complaint. My main problem is with the Debt Collection Company, the lesser complaint is with the school. 

I 'm currently in a dispute with my local community college regarding a small debt, either {$49.00} or {$79.00}, depending who I speak to. In XX/XX/XXXX I took XXXX XXXX XXXX classes and paid upfront with my credit card. One of the classes was canceled, and I was refunded the money for it. XX/XX/XXXX I received in the mail a small slip of paper saying in part : "" Dear XXXX, Please be advised you have a past due balance with XXXX for a XX/XX/XXXX XXXX ... Pay by XX/XX/XXXX '' It did not look like a bill or invoice and my name was not on the slip or the amount owed. I called the college that day and spoke to someone who could n't tell me what class I owed for or provide any of the normal information that one would find on a bill or invoice. The woman I spoke to promised she would do research and get back to me, which never happened. 

I must point out, that I 've never been a matriculated student at this college or had a student loan. I registered and paid for XXXX XXXX classes in XX/XX/XXXX, attended XXXX, the XXXX was canceled, and the money for that class refunded. Also, the paperwork seems to indicate this "" debt '' was for something in XX/XX/XXXX, and I never registered for or attended ANY classes in XXXX. When I got the notice from the debt collector, I called the contact for the college on that notice and failed to receive any meaningful information that would indicate I owed them money. The woman was "" too busy '' to explain it other than to say that XXXX people in her department looked at the paperwork and agreed I owed them money. I responded that they should send me a proper invoice if they have such paperwork. 

At any rate, they sent this alleged debt to AR Resources Inc., and their first contact with me by mail, they sent the notice to an old address. The address is from at least 25 years ago or more. The XXXX college does not have this address on their records, so I believe AR Resources Inc deliberately used an absurdly old address so I would n't get the notice. The reason I got the notice, despite the old address, is because I still live in my home town and people in the Post Office know me and where I live currently. 

I can not stress strongly enough that AR Resources Inc had to deliberately do EXTENSIVE research to find this address. It 's not a simple clerical error. The house number they used was from the pre-XX/XX/XXXX era. Not before XX/XX/XXXX, but literally before my town had XXXX service, you know? When this address was valid, if you needed the police or ambulance, you would have had to dial the XXXX DIGIT PHONE NUMBER ON A ROTARY PHONE.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"AR Resources, Inc.",NJ,083XX,,Consent provided,Web,03/25/2015,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1299885

07/06/2015,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,Settlement process and costs,,"XXXX previous case numberSince my last written complaint, Nationstar approved a HAMP but not what was originally agreed to ( Did not take off my ex husband or give me the interest rate offered by Aurora Bank ). My payment went up with this version of the HAMP but I was told my ex husband who is on the loan would be removed with this new HAMP. So, in order to get my ex husband off the loan I agreed and signed the HAMP. When I received the HAMP paperwork, I was shocked and dismayed my ex husband was still on the paperwork and I got a higher interest rate. Upon calling my rep, he explained that he would attach my divorce decree and quit claim deed where the property was quit claimed to me solely by my ex husband that this would remove his name from the loan. So, I signed and returned the paperwork regardless of the higher rate to attain this end. I attaching the email from the Nationstar rep stating that his name would be removed. I signed the paperwork with my ex husbands name on it without his signature. Nationstar signed and recorded this document ( see attached ). My ex husband served me with a lawsuit for not making payments, ruined his credit, and for not taking him off the loan. When I called Nationstar about this the said they will not remove his name off the loan, even with the paperwork I signed, the proof I sent, and the written email from their company. Now I come to find out that they fraudulently manipulated my credit report to show late payments that never occured putting my payments in a suspense account. All of my payments have been on time and I have copies of the cancelled checks to prove it so. They admitted their manipulation of the credit report however it also affected my ex husbands credit report. Their fraudulent actions not only affected me but my ex husband as well, from which I understand this is a federal offense. I am now in the XXXX year of this process. I accepted Auroras offer at 2 % and taking my ex husbands name off the loan, upon the sale of this loan to Nationstar they claim they lost the paperwork ( funny how they said they lost it but yet they accepted modified payments they said they lost XXXX. So I had to start the process all over again. I have now had to hire XXXX attorneys to try and straighten out this mess. One to defend my husbands lawsuit and the other to make Nationstar do what the said in writing. We are still going back and forth with Nationstar to do what they said.

12/08/2016,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"We were recently denied a settlement counter-offer on a HELOC lien held on our property address. Please know that if we had known about the lien, we would 've continued to pay on it for the past three years. Unfortunately, we were misinformed by a USAA employee in the Bankruptcy Department on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The reason why I reached out to USAA was in order to continue making our monthly HELOC payments. The reason they had ceased is due to our filing a Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy earlier in the year. Once the Bankruptcy was discharged, I reached out to USAA to continue with payments. XXXX advises that since the HELOC was n't reaffirmed, voluntary payments were no longer necessary. I also advised how originally our XXXX XXXX XXXX home mortgage/USAA HELOC was to be included in our Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy, but XXXX XXXX XXXX agreed to a Loan Modification after I filed a complaint with the US Treasury. Again, he stated that we did n't have to pay anything. He also advised we 'd no longer receive paper statements nor would we have online access to statements. In XXXX XXXX, we decided to put our house on the market in order to prepare for our XXXX son 's future. We know that he 'll be living with us for the remainder of his life. We wanted to find a house with a full basement which could eventually be modified into an in-law type suite containing a bedroom, full bathroom, kitchen, as well as a washer/dryer. This is in order for us and his XXXX to work on independent living skills in order to prepare him to become a truly independent young man. Our house sold in 4 days. In preparing the closing documents, the pre-closer advises there 's a lien from USAA on the house. She has the attorney review the bankruptcy and said that the USAA 2nd mtg was discharged in the bankruptcy BUT no lien avoidance order was filed. We need either a release from USAA ( Quitclaim deed, cancellation, etc ) to record at closing or we need a Lien Avoidance from the Bankrtupcy court. We need XXXX of these to clear title and proceed to closing. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX I called USAA and after speaking with XXXX different departments, I 'm then transferred to ext. XXXX and spoke with XXXX inquiring about a lien release. She advised a lien release would occur if the balance of {$19000.00} is paid in full. I explained to her the conversation I had with the Bankruptcy Department on XXXX XXXX and she advised that she was n't involved in that conversation and did n't know what I was told. I then asked about some sort of a negotiated amount. She advised there 's a member assistance program and faxed an application. We filled out all of the documentation including a hardship letter and faxed in our request XXXX XXXX, XXXX. We receive a call from XXXX XXXX ( I 'm not certain if it 's the same XXXX who 'm I spoke with on XXXX XXXX ) stating that it seemed that we wanted to request a settlement option, not a sell short. I advised that is correct. I advised how our house is under contract and has a closing date of XXXX XXXX. She advised that USAA legally has 30 days to make a decision and as of now, our request is incomplete. She asked for a mortgage loan payoff from BAC and pay-stubs. These items were faxed on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Our closing date is then moved to XXXX XXXX, XXXX. We also agree to pay our buyer 's rent for the month of XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received an email from XXXX XXXX stating USAA rejected our settlement offer. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I then submitted a counteroffer and that too was rejected. I spoke with XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, XXXX for further clarification. She advised that since we have sufficient equity in the house to cover the lien, all counters will be rejected. The full loan amount is expected from us in order to lift the Lien.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,UNITED SERVICES AUTOMOBILE ASSOCIATION,GA,301XX,,Consent provided,Web,12/08/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2242023

I had just completed a chapter XXXX bankruptcy in XXXX. My house as well as my trustee payments were under strict compliance. I called Nationstar to resolve this issue but no one I spoke to could give me the dates of the missed payments. I spoke to a Hud councilor who referred me to the CFPB. I submitted a complaint ( case # XXXX XXXX on XXXX. Nationstar researched the problem and found XXXX payments that should have been credited to my account from their bankruptcy department. When I logged on to my account they had credited me with XXXX payments but then had taken one back out. I have since contacted the Attorney General for the state of XXXX as well as the Attorney General of XXXX. Nationstar has replied that now my missing payments were from around XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX was involved in a motion for relief during my bankruptcy. My previous mortgage co. XXXX had changed my house pymt but had not included the escrow amount. When XXXX realized the mistake they filed a motion for relief. I was instructed by my attorney to hold my house payments until the outcome of the hearing. The outcome that was settled on was for me to remit a payment of XXXX and to make XXXX additional pymts of XXXX each month beginning on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. All payments were sent to and deposited by nationstar as they had purchased my mortgage at this time. I am not behind in my mortgage payments.

11/21/2015,Bank account or service,Checking account,Problems caused by my funds being low,,"This is my fifth complaint against Key Bank because of excessive overdraft fees. I am attaching documentation that shows how confusing and dishonest Key Bank 's posting practices are. Unfortunately, this kind of theft affects people like me who do not have assets and have poor credit. Otherwise, I would have an overdraft protection account and I would never incur these fees. This is not only about my funds being low, because actually my funds are n't low right now and I incurred the last XXXX overdraft notices with a positive balance! Now that 's Key Bank Magical Accounting for you! I 'm posting this now but i am accumulating some other concerns that I am noticing now that I am having to pay attention so closely to my account and not rely on Key Bank to do the math. Some of my items disappear from the ledger at times. The other thing that is happening now is that my pending items are coming out of pending status quickly. I will be addressing these things in future complaints. This is takes an incredible amount of my time. I am doing this for other folks who for various reasons are not able to study their accounts. There is no reason why the bank can not add and subtract well enough to keep track of people 's balances. I do n't even know how much I actually have in the bank now. I do n't know how to find out either. I have a ledger that I keep for my own records and it does not coincide with Key Bank 's accounting. Key Bank changes the order of debits and credits in order to receive overdraft funds from people who do not have assets or good credit in order to protect themselves from this stealing in which this bank participates. I have attached the overdraft notice that I received this morning XX/XX/XXXX. And I have attached the ledger from XX/XX/XXXX copied at several times during the day to show first that there is no record in the ledger itself of the XXXX that is credited to the account with the deposit that I made that morning. It shows up in the balance part of the ledger at the top of the page but not in the description. In addition, this same deposit that was made at the ATM disappears later in the day. as does the XXXX debit. Where do they go? There is a note that says that Key Bank is working on the account and some items might not be available, but the question is why would that deposit disappear when it was visible throughout the day as well as the XXXX charge. I have gotten XXXX overdrafts this week for moving money from my basic checking to the Hassle Free account which is my son 's account. They are both my accounts. I should not be penalized for moving my money around between accounts. So on XX/XX/XXXX I started the day with a positive balance and ended the day with a positive balance having deposited XXXX into my account. Yet I bounced XXXX items, though I was only charged for XXXX. this is very unclear unprofessional accounting. If I did not have direct deposits coming into this account, I would close it. And the thing about it is that it would not matter to key bank at all if they lost my business. They do not care about their customers as evidenced by the fact that I have spent a lot of time this week complaining because of their over draft practices and they keep overdrafting me even with a positive balance. Get it together Key Bank. Adding and Subtracting are basic math skills that you should have. Stop reordering items to benefit yourselves. Give people a break. Last month you bounced XXXX debit transactions of mine that came all together to a little over XXXX You made almost XXXX $ off of those transactions.",,KEYCORP,NY,138XX,,Consent provided,Web,11/21/2015,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1666956

04/27/2016,Consumer Loan,Vehicle loan,Managing the loan or lease,,"In XXXX of XXXX I bought a new car. The dealer told me that I would be contacted by Citizen One ( then RBS Citizens ) about the exact amount of each monthly payment and about the exact date each payment would be due. Sometime shortly after that Citizen One sent me my first monthly billing statement. For the next 2 1/2 years Citizen One set a precedent and created an expectation by regularly sending me monthly billing statements. During that time I faithfully made each payment on time and, on several occasions, made monthly payments for several months in advance. For these reasons I relied on receiving my monthly billing statement from Citizen One to know the exact amount of and the exact due date of my next loan installment. In XXXX XXXX Citizen One suddenly and unexpectedly stopped sending me billing statements. I did n't notice ( I had been habituated by their monthly notices and I had been trained to think of sending a payment only after I was notified ) and, as a direct result of Citizen One 's failure to send a monthly billing statement, I was late with my XXXX payment. When their credit department contacted me I sent 2 months payments ( current + one month in advance ) and notified them that I had n't received a statement. Their customer service representative told me that I should have received a monthly billing statement, it was Citizen One 's policy to do so, verified my contact information ( which had n't changed ) and, under the circumstances, waived the {$20.00} fee I had been assessed for being late. She also assured me that I would start to receive monthly billing statements again. Unfortunately, I did not. Nor did I notice. As a result of that failure on the part of Citizen One I was again contacted in XXXX by their credit department that I was late again. I immediately made 2 months payments ( current + one month in advance ) and pled with their customer service department to please get a monthly billing statement to me. Mail it, fax it, e-mail it - I did n't care. Just get one to me. This time they promised to mail me a paper statement and e-mail me my reminders. To date I have n't received either. As a result I was late again in XXXX. I am not accusing Citizen One of intentionally withholding my monthly billing statements but I find it very suspicious that all of my other mail is delivered without incident. I am never - and I do mean never - late with any of my other bills. I also find it convenient ( and profitable ) that Citizen One gains from their own failure! They are now refusing to waive XXXX {$20.00} late fees. Something is very wrong on their end and it is entirely unfair that I am being penalized for not being sent a monthly billing statement which serves as notification that a loan payment in a specific amount is due. Furthermore, I should not be charged {$20.00} fees when my payment is late as a result of neglect or failure on Citizen One 's part to send me a monthly billing statement. I suspect that I am not the only customer of Citizen One with this problem. I have made exhaustive efforts to remedy this issue with the bank but they are intransigent and so I am filing this compliant to get this situation resolved and, on the principles of being fair and taking responsibility for their part in creating this problem, get the outstanding late fees waived and ensure delivery of a monthly billing statement.",,"CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.",IN,460XX,,Consent provided,Web,04/29/2016,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,No,1898052

On XXXX XXXX, I called Ally Bank again ( spend another 30 minutes on the phone ) and they again indicated they would send out paperwork which would need to be notarized.

2 ) Why did they not send out the paperwork after the XXXX XXXX call? 
3 ) Why does the paperwork expire after 8 hours so the consumer can not get access to their funds. Since I was traveling, this delayed me yet another 2 weeks? 
4 ) Why does the paperwork have to be notarized and why does it have to be sent through a secured site. On XXXX XXXX, the check had not been cashed, so I do not understand why this level of difficulty in getting access to my funds.

Ten years ago The State of California Department of Rehabilitation and I entered into an agreement that they would retool me for working from home. In the process of their program, I ran to the limit of Federal Education Loans, and took a Private Student Loan from Sallie Mae. The State had promised to find me work upon completing their program. My XXXX conditions worsened, and the State of California released XXXX XXXX individuals ( I being one of them ) from its program to "" save money '' for the State ( at that time in bad fiscal condition ). My Federal Loans were forgiven as part of my deteriorating XXXX situation, but Sallie Mae would not forgive my loans based on the fact that I knew I was XXXX when I applied for the loan ( even though that was not a factor in the application ). When I explained that my health had continued to disintegrate, they refused to accept this despite letters from my medical providers. My loan continues to grow with fees. I have no savings or any means to repay XXXX or settle with them. Also, I now have the XXXX loan on my credit report. This is a very black mark as I am definitely not a shirker of my responsibilities -- having once been an educator at the university level. I repaid my earlier XXXX loans. However, my current income ( {$1600.00} a month ) is hardly covering my living expenses. I did not get the opportunity to try to work because of the economic downturn. I had to go bankrupt because of accumulated medical expenses from the period that I could n't get insurance because I had preexisting conditions. I am an XXXX XXXX, and I ca n't get any kind of credit line to boost my credit worthiness ( for renting ) because of the bankruptcy, and, more significantly because of the student loan non-repayment. Sallie Mae has been horrible about this ( well-documented by others in a similar position ). I am now "" in collection, '' but have nothing they can levy. I have been unable to work since 1995, and the State of California 's rehab opportunity that they would find me work did not materialize.

When he died in XX/XX/XXXX there was a substantial balance in the account, and I, his wife, was the beneficiary. I knew that IRS rules provided that the named spouse beneficiary "" assumes the account. '' However, when I called to discuss the situation I was told the account would be closed and funds sent to me. I specifically said I did not want the account to be closed. I followed this up with a letter the same day reiterating my wish that the account not be closed and asking that someone contact me about the proper handling of the account. I heard nothing. When I followed up with a phone call, I was told the account was closed and a check was on the way to me. I spoke with several people, all of whom told me the account had to be closed. However, I knew IRS publication XXXX indicated that upon death of account holder, the "" account is treated as the spouse 's HSA. '' The major problem with their closing the account was that they did it around XX/XX/XXXX -- against my wishes -- and at a time when the value of investments in the account had plunged. These investments soon rebounded and even gained in value. However, I missed out on these earnings. I filed a complained with the BBB and the bank restored opened an account in my name and cancelled payment on the check to me. However, the bank has refused to provide me with information about the value of the account as of the date of my husband 's death and the holdings in the investment accounts as of his death and as of the date they sold the investments. As the law says I should "" assume '' this account, I am entitled to this information. I have attempted to get the information from the bank but they refuse. I have no way to know if they restored the correct amount to the account. The bank later made a cash deposit to the account, apparently correcting some error. However, I have no information to assess what they have done. In effect, the bank erroneously made the only investment decisions for the account until I sold the investments in XX/XX/XXXX as I prepare to move the account to an HSA administrator that is more professional. The bank 's website information about the treatment of HSA accounts upon accountholder 's death has changed more than once since my husband 's death and now says the bank has discretion about the treatment of accounts upon death. Are accountholders subject to the whims of a bank clerk? I believe the bank has callously violated my rights and that I have suffered a financial loss as a result. Without all of the required information, it is difficult to assess the damage, but I believe that if the account had simply been changed to my name there would be several more thousand dollars in it than there is now. To make matters worse, this debacle occurred when I was already struggling with the effects of my husband 's death. While other financial institutions were careful to provide detailed information accounts and options, Bank of America ignored my request for information and closed the account without any consideration of the effect it would have on its value.

I set up the transfer on XXXX XXXX. The money was debited from my bank account yesterday, XXXX XXXX, but as of today, XXXX XXXX, it has NOT been credited to my XXXX account! That 's fraud! XXXX took the money from my bank account but kept it for themselves instead of applying it to my XXXX account. I called XXXX about this problem this morning, initially spoke with line representative XXXX XXXX XXXX who was useless about fixing the problem, eventually transferred to a supervisor, XXXX ( employee ID # XXXX XXXX. Unfortunately, XXXX also refused to do anything to fix this fraud, just blithely repeating that it takes several days to effect such a transfer. That 's not the point ; the point is they already have the money but have n't credited to my XXXX account. You need to force these crooks to stop screwing over people like me and to treat their customers fairly and respectfully, especially by transferring and crediting money immediately on the requests being filed ( as they do for purchases on XXXX paid with XXXX ), not depriving clients of the use of their own money, and not playing around with floats to earn interest to which they are not entitled. And - to start with - they should never debit peoples ' XXXX accounts on the unsupported claims of third parties. The fact of the matter is that it 's MY decision if I believe it 's appropriate or not to refund money to a buyer ( as it may not be if the buyer broke the merchandise after using it, as may be the case with the buyer who currently wants to return merchandise to me ) and XXXX and XXXX should not be able to force such a decision on me and definitely should NOT steal money from me! This vertical monopoly of XXXX and XXXX needs to be broken up because it leads to abuses of power by both entities. Specifically, for my current complaint, I 'm asking you to fine XXXX and force them to immediately credit my account the full amount of money that I transferred and that is at issue with the buyer XXXX {$27.00} plus {$80.00} XXXX.",,PAYPAL HOLDINGS INC.,MT,592XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,03/25/2015,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1301385

My statements were sent by e-mail and I would then pay online, always in full. Last XXXX, I did not receive a statement from Target. I do not remember the exact dates for all of my financial obligations and rely on statements from my creditors. Two months later, I received an e-mail from Target informing me they were turning me over to a collection agency. I called them and told them I wanted to pay the debt in full but also wanted to cancel the card because their statement system did not seem adequate ( i.e. no statements sent ) and I could n't take any chances with ruining my credit. They informed me that it was my responsibility to know when the bills were due and if I cancelled my care, I would never be able to get another one again. I told them that was fine, this was n't working for me, and I had other credit cards. I paid the card in full and owed nothing to Target. In XXXX of 2016, I applied for new car insurance because it was much cheaper. I was told that I would have to pay {$150.00} more for insurance because I had an entry on my credit card. I got a copy of my credit report, and for the first time in my adult life ( I 'm XXXX ), I had a bad credit report from Target. I am now also applying for XXXX jobs and have found out this can also affect my ability to get a job. Target does not have any customer service contacts for this issue as I do not have a Target Red Card anymore and you need a card number to log in into the customer service portal. There is no other mechanism for contacting them about this issue. My question is, if I paid them in full two months after the debt was due, why have they ruined my credit rating? This card has cost me far more than I ever saved by using it and now it is going to potentially impair my ability to get a job. I feel as if I 've committed a felony and I would like Target to resolve this ; I do n't owe them anything and they did n't have to pay anything to collect the debt. It just seems like sheer vindictiveness, which I think stems from my not wanting to use their card anymore.

This year with graduation as a XXXX we elected to just go back to making monthly payments well we did not relize that over time each payment was slightly short a few dolars or cents. Instead of notifying us of this even though we were calling and physically talking to an employee working at Guild that was giving us the amount to pay they would just put the money in an "" undisclosed account '' and repeatedly reported us to the credit bureau.

She no longer works for company ) identifying herself calling from Financial Management Systems ( FMS ) stating I had a debt in their office from XXXX XXXX. Advised I was out of town but would call the company back when I came home. I continued to receive collection calls and never received debt validation. On XXXX, I spoke to XXXX different people regarding my debt, advising that I needed a letter showing the total due. Every person I spoke to was incompetent and rude. FMS failed to provide this letter after their first collection call. In order to cease the numerous collection calls, I set up payment arrangements and made my first payment. Only after I requested debt validation, did I receive a "" demand letter '' for the incorrect amount-after I had already made a payment. I continued receiving collection calls from reps, even after I set up payment arrangements, trying to settle my account in a lump sum. XXXX day, I received collection call at my employer, having never given this #. When asked how they got my work #, they advised it came over with my file. I stated I never gave the # out so that was untrue. Then I was advised they were skip tracing my account because they did not have a good number for my account. Advised that they had my cell # & that was good because they call me all the time for collections. 
On XXXX, I called trying to get better contact information regarding my account as I was intending to pay it off and spoke to XXXX, I was then transferred to manager, XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX as my account had a Cease & Desist flag placed on it due to the issues I experienced when I called in & with receiving a collection call at my employer. Call was disconnected. 
On XXXX, I called spoke to XXXX about payoff procedures. 
On XXXX, I received a loan from my bank & asked the company to send a XXXX-day payoff via fax so the bank had the correct amount. The only piece of information I had to give to the bank for debt validation was the incorrect demand letter I had to previously request from FMS - it did not reflect XXXX payments I had made on my account. I had asked for the updated amount to be sent to my bank - FMS failed to send anything in writing. When I spoke to XXXX, I requested the correct amount to be sent to my bank again & also requested copies of my receipts for my XXXX payments sent to me. I was told that due to privacy issues, I can not get receipts for my payments, rather I can use my own bank statements. When I called in on XXXX, she advised that there was a note on my account by the manager to immediately fax the correct payoff letter & my receipts to the bank. I called my bank to verify & they still had yet to receive any faxes from FMS. Instead, my bank used my "" demand letter '' ( again, previously requested by me, not sent by the FMS per law ) & the XXXX payments I stated I had made in order to send a check for the amount of {$3900.00}. Since there was n't any late fees or interest accruing, I knew this was the balance, although I did not have proof from FMS. After allowing time for the payment to be received, I called back on XXXX and spoke to XXXX, stated check was received/applied on XXXX. When I asked about receipts, he stated he would send me back to XXXX since we had spoken before. She advised that FMS was unable to provide due to privacy & legal issues. I continued checking w/ my bank who never received any information from FMS. I called back on XXXX & XXXX transferred me to XXXX XXXX, who is very rude, interrupts conversation, acts like he is inconvenienced to be on the phone. I asked for a new manager and was xfer to XXXX. Explained situation again, said he would have to speak to XXXX XXXX & call me back in XXXX mins. Received call XXXX hrs later & said he would have to call me back the following day.

01/29/2017,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"I am writing to document a formal complaint against XXXX and LoanCare mortgage servicing companies. 

Recently, XXXX ( XXXX, XXXX ) purchased my mortgage from my previous lender, LoanCare ( www.myloancare.com ). The transfer process has been very frustrating ; consumers should not be collateral damage in the loan transfer process, particularly given the fact that consumers do not consent to the buying and selling of their mortgages. This has created an incredible amount of work for me and wasted a lot of time, and this clearly has been the case for others too, as evidenced by XXXX ' reviews and LoanCare online. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, payment from XXXX to LoanCare went through for the remaining principle ( based on a XX/XX/XXXX calculation ) for my mortgage ; however, on XX/XX/XXXX, LoanCare also auto-drafted the monthly payment from my checking account. LoanCare does not have record of this on my online profile and they have not forwarded this payment to XXXX as both companies have said they would through the transfer process. 

XXXX now has sent me to a debt collector for failure to pay my XXXX payment and plans to auto- draft double my monthly payment from my checking account on XX/XX/XXXX. 

This is unacceptable, and has to stop. Consumers rights need to be protected during the home buying and selling process and the onus of record keeping should not fall to the consumer, the innocent bystander in this process. 

To make matters worse, neither LoanCare nor XXXX offers customer support on the weekends. I work a very busy job with long hours and am not available to troubleshoot and clean up the mess that XXXX has created during the weekdays.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"LoanCare, LLC",CO,802XX,,Consent provided,Web,01/29/2017,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2316838

07/29/2015,Credit reporting,,Incorrect information on credit report,Information is not mine,"On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I was checking my Credit XXXX. I discovered that on XXXX XXXX, 2015, there was a hard credit check XXXX on Equifax Credit reporting Agency. I did not open an account XXXX nor do I even have a cellphone from any company. I immediately contacted XXXX XXXX and advised them that I did not open an account. I was informed that indeed, an account was opened in my name and using my Social Security number. The Fraud department was closed since it was a weekend but I was advised to call back on Monday morning. I then proceeded to contact all the Credit Reporting Agencies and place an alert. I contacted EquifaxXXXX. After completing this, I contacted my credit card companies and had them place a watch on my accounts. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I spoke with the XXXX XXXX Fraud Department and filed a Fraud complaint. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I received a letter from the XXXX XXXX Fraud Department advising that the account in my name was fraudulent. I contacted the XXXX Fraud Department on this date by telephone. I was told that the fraudulent account was closed and a letter was sent to Equifax requesting that the Credit Check be removed from my credit report. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I contacted Equifax. Equifax is the only Credit Reporting Agency where this credit check appeared. I spoke with XXXX at XXXX. I asked her why the credit check was still on my credit report. XXXX stated that she does not show a letter XXXX in my file. As a result of this conversation, I contacted XXXX again. I was advised that they did in deed send a letter to Equifax requesting that the credit check be removed. Further, I did a cover letter and sent Equifax a copy of the letter which I received XXXX. This was sent in a fax for which I have a confirmation of receipt. My letter also requested that the credit check be removed immediately. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I received a letter from a third party company indicating that a hack had occurred on a company called XXXX. XXXX is a company that operates for XXXX, Florida XXXX. In this hack, employee and retired employee names, addresses, Social Security numbers, email addresses, pass words, etc. had been stolen. Obviously, this is where the suspect in the XXXX fraudulent account obtained my name and Social Security number. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I called XXXX XXXX Fraud Department. I advised them that Equifax claims that they did not send a letter to remove the fraudulent credit check. I was informed that this was not true. While on the telephone, the employee typed out another letter to Equifax and sent it. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I called Equifax again. The credit check XXXX is still showing on my credit report. The employee at Equifax told me that they have no documentation showing this credit check to be a fraud. I told the employee that she is a liar. I stated that I have the confirmation in which I faxed them my statement along with the XXXX letter. I then informed the employee that XXXX sent them another letter and I wanted to speak to a supervisor. The employee stated that there was nothing that could be done for me and the credit check only lasts on my report for two years. I told her that she was complicit in this fraud complaint and that she is a liar. As a result of this last conversation with Equifax, I contacted the Attorney General 's Office and was advised to file this complaint. See the attached documentation. I need this fraudulent credit check removed by Equifax.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",FL,334XX,,Consent provided,Web,07/29/2015,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1492393

03/17/2016,Credit reporting,,Credit reporting company's investigation,Problem with statement of dispute,"Hello, I have been a victim of Identity theft on multiple occasions since 2012 and have reported this to many government agencies including the FTC, IRS, XXXX Police and more. As a result my information has been misused fraudulently and there were charges incurred by parties unknown to me on several occasions on many of my accounts and I have been working relentlessly to remedy the negative effects of this. Almost ALL of the creditors and reporting agencies have done their own investigations and come to the realization that I have indeed been victimized, and most have cleared up their files. 

The one outrageous entity remaining, is XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX in XXXX, CA, and their XXXX Collector, XXXX XXXX , who not only refuses to accept the numerous documentation and disputes I have submitted thru the past several years, but also keeps adding {$10000.00} to the fictitious amount they have been reporting ( over {$30000.00} ) each time I dispute their ridiculous charade! Their attempts to pressure the consumer by intimidation are beyond reason! Their lack of willingness to examine the evidence and come to the conclusions that everyone else has, seems like a sinister ordeal! Furthermore, this is all on a corporate account that I was associated with as one of the managers! Where is the Original Instrument of debt? Why are they pursuing me when they have no other recourse? 

Their Ref. # is : XXXX / XXXX ( original Creditor of record ) file number is XXXX The corporation in question was XXXX XXXX XXXX which was owned by some other corporation, ALL of which are dissolved. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX info is : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX . XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX Contact : XXXX XXXX, XXXX Collector Ph. XXXX Fax : XXXX They continue to disregard the fact that XXXX HAS acknowledged that there was indeed fraudulent activity, unauthorized account ( s ) and unauthorized use of my information ( XXXX file # XXXX ), and that we have always continued to dispute their report, and said balances and amounts repeatedly. In fact, the representatives from XXXX ( and on a separate occasion, an IRS agent ) are the ones who informed me about the fraudulent activities, and I was unaware of this and the extent of it previous to that! 
Further, the above referenced claim is on a corporate account, and that company was owned by yet XXXX other corporations, all of which have been dissolved and out of business for several years. Simply having been point of contact, or having made any good faith efforts to resolve this while investigating the information does not constitute acceptance of liability by me personally, nor an agreement to the accuracy of the information reported by said collection company in any way. 
Initially, XXXX notified us of fraudulent activity, the IRS investigated and notified me of falsified Tax reports under my information and fixed it and recommended putting a Fraud Alert on my file. Police, FTC and other authorities were notified and reports were filed and Credit Freeze/Alerts were put in place. Since then, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and several other institutions have investigated and acknowledge this and ALL have corrected their records. Yet they refuse to comply despite having been provided with ample documentation to that effect and several letters of dispute! 
I have continuously disputed the information, and any personal liability in this matter. That position has not changed, and I demand - once again - that this be corrected and struck from any consumer reports. I am attaching some of the aforementioned supporting documents, and there more available upon request. I appreciate your attention to this matter!

10/12/2015,Credit card,,Rewards,,"The credit card company ( American Express ) changed my credit card from one type ( Blue Cash ) to another ( Blue Cash Everyday ) without my consent, and I would lose cash back money because of that. My current card has an annual cycle system for cash back, which means that the cash back I get depends upon the purchases I have made with this card during a 12 month period. My cycle starts on XXXX of XXXX of each year, and I get a lower cash back percentage for the first {$6500.00} I spend with this card, and after that I get more cash back percentage. This year 's cycle also started on XXXX of XXXX, and in the past 4 months, I have made most of my purchases with this card so that I reach the {$6500.00} limit as soon as possible, and start getting more cash back. Now, just when I am about to reach this limit, the credit card company has sent me a letter notifying me that my card has been converted to a different type, which has a completely different cash back system, and as a result, I would receive much lower cash back compared to what I would have gotten with the old card upon reaching the {$6500.00} limit. I contacted their customer service many times and all of their agents understood my issue, but ultimately did n't do anything other than apologizing to me. I told to the agents that this is cheating, and they said that this is a company-wide policy and they have no control on it. As a solution, I offered them to change my card after my current cycle ends, but they denied it. I also offered them to give a higher cash back on previous and future purchases to compensate for my loss, but they denied it.",,AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY,IL,604XX,,Consent provided,Web,10/12/2015,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1603029
